## Task
We are looking to see how you interact with code (in this case it's code generated by AI - it will not work out of the box), how you test it, what you choose to improve, what deficiencies in generated code you notice.
This task simulates what youâ€™d do with an actual external integration and internal data ingestion pipeline.
TALK US THROUGH YOUR THINKING.

### The Problem
#### Assumptions
You are allowed to do any changes to the code or setup.
Externa API Docs: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs

- [ ] fix application so it runs in docker
- [ ] ingest hourly weather data for a given location (e.g., Berlin) from a public API and store it in your internal system.
    - The weather data is fetched from:
    - `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&hourly=temperature_2m`
- [ ] `POST /sync-weather` when called, this endpoint should:
    - Fetch the temperature forecast from the Open-Meteo API for Berlin (52.52, 13.41)
    - Parse the data (use hourly.time and hourly.temperature_2m)
    - Insert this data into a SQLite table called weather with:
        time TIME_STAMP,
        temperature_celsius REAL
    - Return a response like: `{ "rows_upserted": 24 }`

- [ ] `GET /week` return data forecast for upcoming week with an average daylight temeprature per day: `[ <date>: <celcius> ]`
- [ ] discuss how to make this application, production ready (I would love to learn your definition of production ready)

# Weather Data Ingestor

A FastAPI application that fetches weather data from Open-Meteo API and stores it in SQLite.

## Features

- Fetches hourly temperature data for Berlin (latitude: 52.52, longitude: 13.41)
- Stores data in SQLite database
- Provides API endpoints for data ingestion and retrieval

## API Endpoints

- `POST /ingest` - Fetches and stores new weather data
- `GET /weather` - Retrieves stored weather data (default limit: 10 records)

## Setup and Running

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed

2. Build and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. The application will be available at http://localhost:8000

4. Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs

## Local Development

For local development without Docker:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
